    "# Job Assignment Problem Using Branch and Bound Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "# Theory Explanation:\n",
    "# The Job Assignment Problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem. \n",
    "# Given a set of workers and jobs, where each worker can be assigned to a job \n",
    "# at a certain cost, the goal is to find an optimal assignment (minimizing total cost) \n",
    "# where each worker is assigned exactly one job, and vice versa.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In this code, the Branch and Bound strategy is used to solve this assignment problem.\n",
    "# This strategy breaks the problem into smaller subproblems (branching) and uses bounds \n",
    "# to eliminate parts of the search space that cannot provide a better solution than the current best (bounding).\n",
    "# It efficiently prunes the search space to avoid exploring unpromising assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step-by-step Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "# Node Class: The Node class represents a state in the search tree:\n",
    "# - workerID: The worker being considered in this state.\n",
    "# - jobID: The job assigned to the worker in this state.\n",
    "# - assigned: A list that tracks which jobs have been assigned to workers so far.\n",
    "# - parent: The parent node in the search tree (used for backtracking).\n",
    "# - pathCost: The total cost of the path to reach this node.\n",
    "# - cost: An estimated cost to reach the goal from this node. \n",
    "#   This is the sum of pathCost and the lower bound for the remaining assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# CustomHeap Class: A min-heap is used to select the node with the minimum cost (priority queue). \n",
    "# This ensures that the algorithm explores the least costly path first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# calc_cost Function: This function calculates the lower bound (or estimate) of the remaining cost from a given node.\n",
    "# - It computes the minimum possible cost for the unassigned jobs from the current worker onward.\n",
    "# - This estimate is used for bounding the search tree, eliminating paths that cannot yield a better solution than the best known solution.\n",
    "# Formula used:\n",
    "# cost = sum(min(c[i, j]) for j âˆ‰ assigned_jobs for i from x+1 to N)\n",
    "# where c[i,j] is the cost of assigning worker i to job j.\n",
    "\n",
    "# find_min_cost Function: This is the main function that implements the Branch and Bound strategy. \n",
    "# It performs the following steps:\n",
    "# - Initializes a priority queue (min-heap) and pushes the root node with an initial cost of zero.\n",
    "# - Iteratively pops the node with the lowest cost from the heap and considers assigning the next worker (based on the workerID).\n",
    "# - For each unassigned job, a new child node is created, and its path cost is updated.\n",
    "# - The lower bound is calculated for the child node using calc_cost.\n",
    "# - The child node is pushed back into the heap.\n",
    "# - The process continues until all workers are assigned jobs (when i == N), at which point the assignment is printed and the total cost is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The key insight is that, by expanding nodes in order of their estimated cost (including both pathCost and lower bound), \n",
    "# we explore the most promising solutions first and prune suboptimal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Backtracking and Printing Assignments: The function print_assig recursively prints the job assignments starting from \n",
    "# the final node (leaf) to the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mathematical Formulation:\n",
    "# The Job Assignment Problem can be represented as:\n",
    "# Objective: Minimize the total cost C of assigning workers to jobs.\n",
    "# C = sum(c[i, j] for i=1 to N)\n",
    "# where c[i, j] is the cost of assigning worker i to job j.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Constraints:\n",
    "# - Each worker is assigned exactly one job.\n",
    "# - Each job is assigned exactly one worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Branch and Bound Approach:\n",
    "# - Branching: At each level, a worker is assigned to a job, creating a branch. \n",
    "#   The search tree grows as workers are assigned jobs, and we explore all possible assignments.\n",
    "# - Bounding:\n",
    "#   - For each node, the cost is calculated, and a lower bound is used to estimate the remaining cost of completing the assignment.\n",
    "#   - Nodes that cannot lead to a better solution than the best known solution are pruned, reducing the search space.\n",
    "#   - This ensures that the algorithm explores promising nodes first and avoids unnecessary exploration of suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "# Time Complexity: The algorithm explores N! possible assignments in the worst case, as there are N workers and N jobs. \n",
    "# However, by using bounding, the algorithm prunes much of the search space, potentially reducing the number of nodes explored. \n",
    "# In the worst case, the time complexity is O(N!), but the bounding reduces it significantly in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Space Complexity: The space complexity is dominated by the size of the search tree and the priority queue (heap),\n",
    "# which could hold up to N! nodes. Therefore, the space complexity is also O(N!) in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of Job Assignment Code:\n",
    "# The Job Assignment problem is widely applicable in various fields:\n",
    "# - Manufacturing and Production: Assigning workers to tasks or machines to minimize production costs.\n",
    "# - Logistics: Assigning delivery vehicles to destinations to minimize transportation costs.\n",
    "# - Project Management: Assigning team members to projects or tasks with different costs and skill requirements.\n",
    "# - Airline Crew Scheduling: Assigning airline crew members to flights while minimizing the cost of assignments.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exam Questions and Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. What is the time complexity of the Branch and Bound algorithm used in this code?\n",
    "# Answer: The time complexity in the worst case is O(N!) due to the factorial growth of possible assignments. \n",
    "# However, the algorithm uses bounding to prune much of the search space, so the actual time may be much less than this in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is the purpose of the calc_cost function in this code?\n",
    "# Answer: The calc_cost function calculates the lower bound (or estimate) of the remaining cost for a given node. \n",
    "# It estimates the minimal cost required to complete the assignments for unassigned workers and jobs, \n",
    "# helping to prune suboptimal branches of the search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Explain the significance of the pathCost and cost attributes in the Node class.\n",
    "# Answer: The pathCost represents the total cost incurred to reach a node, while the cost represents the total estimated cost, \n",
    "# including the pathCost and the lower bound of the remaining assignments. The cost is used for selecting the node to expand next in the Branch and Bound strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is the role of the priority queue (min-heap) in this algorithm?\n",
    "# Answer: The priority queue ensures that the node with the least cost is expanded first, \n",
    "# which is crucial for the efficiency of the Branch and Bound algorithm. \n",
    "# It allows the algorithm to explore the most promising assignments first and prune suboptimal ones quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Why is it necessary to check if the number of workers and jobs are equal in the code?\n",
    "# Answer: In the Job Assignment Problem, the number of workers must equal the number of jobs to ensure that each worker is assigned exactly one job \n",
    "# and each job gets exactly one worker. If the numbers do not match, it would not be possible to create a valid assignment, and the problem would be unsolvable.\n"

    "# In the worst case, we need to explore all possible assignments of workers to jobs, which leads to O(N!) possible solutions (where N is the number of workers/jobs).\n",
    "# Each node requires finding the minimum cost for unassigned jobs, which takes O(N) time.\n",
    "# The total number of nodes processed is at most N!, so the overall time complexity is O(N! Ã— N).\n",

    "# Space Complexity:\n",
    "# The space complexity is dominated by the storage of the priority queue and the recursive function calls.\n",

    "# Application of Job Assignment Code:\n",
    "# The Job Assignment Problem has several practical applications, including:\n",
    "# - Workforce management: Assigning tasks to workers in an optimal way to minimize labor costs.\n",
    "# - Manufacturing: Assigning machines to tasks in a factory setup.\n",
    "# - Resource allocation: Optimally assigning resources to tasks to minimize costs or time, such as in project management.\n",

    "# Exam Questions:\n",
    "# Question 1:\n",
    "# What does the calc_cost function do, and why is it important in the branch and bound strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: The calc_cost function calculates the lower bound for the remaining assignments after a partial assignment.\n",
    "# It finds the minimum possible cost for unassigned jobs and workers, and this helps prune the search tree, ensuring that only potentially optimal nodes are explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2:\n",
    "# What is the time complexity of this algorithm, and what is the reason for it?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: The time complexity is O(N! Ã— N). The N! comes from the number of possible assignments of workers to jobs,\n",
    "# and the N factor comes from calculating the minimum cost for each node (which involves iterating over all remaining jobs for each worker).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3:\n",
    "# Explain how the greedy strategy is implemented in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: The greedy strategy is implemented by always selecting the node with the minimum cost (cost), \n",
    "# which is a combination of the path cost and the lower bound heuristic. This ensures that the algorithm explores the least costly options first, potentially leading to the optimal solution faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4:\n",
    "# What happens if the number of workers is not equal to the number of jobs?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: If the number of workers is not equal to the number of jobs, the algorithm prints an error message and does not proceed,\n",
    "# as the assignment is not feasible. The problem assumes that each worker is assigned exactly one job, and each job is assigned to exactly one worker.\n"
