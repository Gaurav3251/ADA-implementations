    "# How it works: It splits the string at position pos and inserts the new character ch between them.\n",
    "# Code:\n",
    "# return s[:pos] + ch + s[pos:]\n",
    "# s[:pos]: substring before the pos index.\n",
    "# ch: character to insert.\n",

    "# Complexity:\n",
    "# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n",
    "# Space complexity: O(n), because a new string is created.\n",

    "# Purpose: Adds random lowercase letters to the password s to meet a required length.\n",
    "# How it works:\n",
    "# The function loops need times to add a random lowercase letter at a random position in the string s.\n",
    "# random.randint(0, len(s)) generates a random position to insert the character.\n",
    "# random.randint(0, 25) generates a random integer to select a letter from the lowercase alphabet (a to z).\n",
    "# Complexity:\n",
    "# Time complexity: O(n + need), where n is the initial length of s, and need is the number of characters to be added.\n",
    "# Space complexity: O(n + need), because a new string is created.\n",

    "# 3. suggester(l, u, d, s, st) Function:\n",
    "# Purpose: Suggests a stronger password by adding characters of specific types (lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character).\n",
    "# How it works:\n",
    "# If the password lacks a certain type of character, the function inserts a random character of that type at a random position.\n",
    "# The parameters l, u, d, and s indicate whether the password already contains a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, or special character, respectively.\n",

    "# 4. gen_password(n, p) Function:\n",
    "# Purpose: Classifies the strength of the given password and suggests stronger alternatives if needed.\n",
    "# How it works:\n",
    "# It checks the password composition by iterating through each character in the password p and checking its type (lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character).\n",
    "# Based on the composition and length (n), the password strength is classified into one of four categories:\n",
    "# - Very Weak: If the password is very short or lacks various character types.\n",
    "# - Weak: If the password has at least two types and a length of 4 or more.\n",
    "# - Moderate: If the password has at least three types and a length of 6 or more.\n",
    "# - Strong: If the password has all four types and a length of 8 or more.\n",
    "# If the password strength is not \"Strong\", it suggests 10 new passwords with at least 8 characters, randomly inserting the missing character types (using the suggester function) and adding random characters (using add_char).\n",
    "# Complexity:\n",
    "# Time complexity:\n",
    "# - Checking composition: O(n), where n is the length of the password.\n",
    "# - Suggesting passwords: O(10 × n), where each suggested password is built by calling suggester and add_char functions.\n",
    "# Total time complexity: O(n + 10n) = O(n), where n is the length of the password.\n",

    "# Strong if length ≥ 8 and all character types present\n",
    "# }\n",
    "\n",

    "# Application of the Password Generator Code:\n",
    "# - Password Strength Evaluation: This code can be used to evaluate the strength of user-generated passwords, which is useful for password management systems, security systems, or user authentication platforms.\n",
    "# - Password Suggestions: It can help users by suggesting stronger passwords that meet security requirements (e.g., a mix of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters).\n",
    "# - Security Systems: The code could be integrated into security software, websites, or applications that require users to set strong passwords, ensuring users don't create weak passwords that are vulnerable to attacks.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Exam Questions Based on the Code:\n",
    "# 1. Question: What does the suggester function do, and how does it improve password strength?\n",
    "#    Answer: The suggester function checks if the password is missing any required character types (lowercase, uppercase, digit, special character). If any are missing, it inserts a random character of the missing type at a random position in the password. This helps improve the password by ensuring it contains a variety of character types, which strengthens it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Question: How does the password strength classification work in the gen_password function?\n",
    "#    Answer: The password strength classification depends on two factors: the length of the password (n) and the presence of character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters). If the password is long enough (≥8 characters) and contains all four types, it's classified as \"Strong.\" If it has 3 types and a length ≥6, it's \"Moderate.\" If it has 2 types and a length ≥4, it's \"Weak.\" Otherwise, it’s classified as \"Very Weak.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Question: What is the role of the add_char function, and why is it necessary?\n",
    "#    Answer: The add_char function adds random lowercase characters to the password if it is shorter than 8 characters. This is necessary to ensure that the password reaches the minimum length requirement for a \"Strong\" password, which helps improve password security.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Question: What would happen if the gen_password function is given a password that is already classified as \"Strong\"?\n",
    "#    Answer: If the password is classified as \"Strong,\" the function will not suggest any new passwords, and it will print \"Your password is classified as: Strong.\" No further modifications are made to the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Question: What are the time and space complexities of the gen_password function?\n",
    "#    Answer: The time complexity of the gen_password function is O(n), where n is the length of the password, as it processes the password once to classify its strength and suggests up to 10 passwords. The space complexity is also O(n) because the function stores and manipulates strings while generating new passwords.\n"
