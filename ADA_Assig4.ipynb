    "# Graph Coloring Problem using Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective:\n",
    "# Assign colors to all vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input:\n",
    "# An adjacency matrix representing the graph (graph).\n",
    "# The number of colors (m).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Core Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "# is_safe(v, graph, color, c):\n",
    "# Checks whether assigning color c to vertex v violates the coloring constraints:\n",
    "# Loops through all vertices. If v is adjacent to vertex i (i.e., graph[v][i] == 1), ensures c is not already assigned to vertex i.\n",
    "\n",
    "# graph_coloring_util(graph, m, color, v):\n",
    "# A recursive function implementing backtracking:\n",
    "# Base Case: If all vertices are colored (v == V), return True.\n",
    "# Recursive Case: For every color from 1 to m, check if assigning the color is safe using is_safe.\n",
    "# If safe, assign the color and recursively call graph_coloring_util for the next vertex (v + 1).\n",
    "# If no valid color works, backtrack by resetting the color (color[v] = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "# graph_coloring(graph, m):\n",
    "# Initializes the coloring process and checks if a solution exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input and Output:\n",
    "# Inputs:\n",
    "# - Number of vertices (V).\n",
    "# - Adjacency matrix of size V x V.\n",
    "# - Number of colors (m).\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# - Prints the solution if it exists or indicates failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Backtracking is Used:\n",
    "# Backtracking systematically explores all potential solutions for the graph coloring problem. \n",
    "# The algorithm explores one vertex at a time and assigns a valid color while keeping track of previously assigned colors. \n",
    "# If no valid color is found for a vertex, the algorithm backtracks to the previous vertex to change its color.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mathematical Representation:\n",
    "# Let V = {v1, v2, …, vn} be the set of vertices.\n",
    "# Assign a color ci from the set of m colors {1, 2, …, m} to each vi, such that:\n",
    "# ci ≠ cj if (vi, vj) ∈ E, where E is the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Backtracking explores solutions recursively:\n",
    "# If a valid ci is found for vi, proceed to vi+1.\n",
    "# If no valid ci exists, reset ci and backtrack to vi−1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Complexity:\n",
    "# Type: The graph coloring problem is NP-complete (for m ≥ 3).\n",
    "# - No known polynomial-time algorithm exists for the general case.\n",
    "# - Verifying a solution is possible in polynomial time, hence NP-complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "# Time Complexity:\n",
    "# In the worst case, for V vertices and m colors:\n",
    "# O(m^V)\n",
    "# Each vertex can be assigned m colors, and there are V vertices to process.\n",
    "# Space Complexity:\n",
    "# Space required for recursion stack and color array:\n",
    "# O(V)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of Graph Coloring:\n",
    "# 1. Resource Allocation: Assigning frequencies in wireless networks to avoid interference.\n",
    "# 2. Scheduling: Allocating timeslots for exams/classes ensuring no student has overlapping exams/classes.\n",
    "# 3. Map Coloring: Coloring regions on a map such that no two adjacent regions have the same color.\n",
    "# 4. Register Allocation: Assigning variables to registers in compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exam Invigilator Role: Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q1: What is the base case in the recursive function graph_coloring_util?\n",
    "# Answer: The base case occurs when all vertices are successfully colored, i.e., when v == V. The function then returns True.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Why do we use backtracking in this problem?\n",
    "# Answer: Backtracking is used to explore all potential solutions systematically and revert to previous states if a solution is not feasible. \n",
    "# This ensures all possible configurations are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: What happens if no valid color is found for a vertex?\n",
    "# Answer: The algorithm backtracks by resetting the color of the current vertex (color[v] = 0) and tries the next possible color for the previous vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: What does the function is_safe check?\n",
    "# Answer: It checks whether assigning a specific color to a vertex is valid by ensuring no adjacent vertex has the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: What is the time complexity of this algorithm for V = 4 and m = 3?\n",
    "# Answer: The time complexity is O(m^V), so for V = 4 and m = 3, it is:\n",
    "# O(3^4) = 81.\n"
