    "# 0/1 Knapsack Problem Code Explanation\n",
    "# The 0/1 Knapsack problem involves selecting a subset of items to maximize the total value that can be carried by a knapsack of a limited capacity. \n",
    "# Each item has a weight and a value, and the goal is to determine the maximum value of items that can be placed in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Breakdown:\n",
    "# 1. Knapsack Function (knapSack)\n",
    "# The function knapSack(W, wt, val, n) implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem. Here's how it works step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inputs:\n",
    "# W: The capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "# wt: A list of weights of the items.\n",
    "# val: A list of values of the items.\n",
    "# n: The number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the DP table:\n",
    "# K is a 2D table (array) where K[i][w] stores the maximum value achievable with the first i items and a knapsack capacity w.\n",
    "# The table is initialized with zeros, where K[i][w] = 0 if either i = 0 or w = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Programming Transition:\n",
    "# For each item i (from 1 to n) and each weight w (from 0 to W), we determine if the current item should be included in the knapsack.\n",
    "# If the weight of the current item (wt[i-1]) is less than or equal to the current capacity (w), we have two choices:\n",
    "# 1. Include the item: Add its value val[i-1] and subtract its weight wt[i-1] from the current capacity.\n",
    "# 2. Exclude the item: Simply carry forward the value of the previous row K[i-1][w].\n",
    "\n",
    "# The decision is made by taking the maximum of the two options:\n",
    "# K[i][w] = max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]], K[i-1][w])\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the current item's weight exceeds the capacity w, we cannot include the item, so we take the value from the row above:\n",
    "# K[i][w] = K[i-1][w]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result:\n",
    "# The value K[n][W] will contain the maximum value that can be placed in the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Main Function (main)\n",
    "# The main function provides an interactive interface for the user to input the number of items, their values, weights, and the knapsack capacity.\n",
    "# It then calls the knapSack function to compute and display the maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The menu allows the user to run the knapsack algorithm or exit. If the user selects \"Run Knapsack,\" \n",
    "# it takes the input values, checks for consistency (i.e., the number of values and weights should match the number of items), and prints the result. \n",
    "# If the user selects \"Exit,\" the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic Programming Strategy Explanation\n",
    "# The dynamic programming approach is used to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem because it efficiently finds the optimal solution \n",
    "# by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them in a bottom-up manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Theory Behind Dynamic Programming (DP):\n",
    "# Subproblem Structure: The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems where the solution for a given problem depends on the solutions to smaller subproblems. \n",
    "# In this case, the subproblem is determining the maximum value achievable for a given subset of items and a specific knapsack capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Optimal Substructure: The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. This is represented by the recurrence relation:\n",
    "# K[i][w] = max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]], K[i-1][w])\n",
    "\n",
    "# This recurrence allows us to build up solutions to larger problems using the solutions to smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overlapping Subproblems: In the 0/1 Knapsack problem, many subproblems are solved multiple times. \n",
    "# For example, we may calculate the maximum value for the same weight multiple times for different items. \n",
    "# Dynamic programming solves each subproblem once and stores the result, avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mathematical Formula / Equation:\n",
    "# The DP transition is based on this recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# K[i][w] = \n",
    "#     { \n",
    "#         0 if i = 0 or w = 0\n",
    "#         max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]], K[i-1][w]) if wt[i-1] <= w\n",
    "#         K[i-1][w] if wt[i-1] > w\n",
    "#     }\n",
    "\n",
    "# Where:\n",
    "# K[i][w] is the maximum value achievable with the first i items and a knapsack capacity w.\n",
    "# wt[i-1] and val[i-1] are the weight and value of the ith item.\n",
    "# If the current item is too heavy to fit in the knapsack (i.e., wt[i-1] > w), we exclude it and carry forward the value K[i-1][w].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexity:\n",
    "# The time complexity of the 0/1 Knapsack DP algorithm is O(n * W), where:\n",
    "# - n is the number of items.\n",
    "# - W is the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "# This is because we need to fill a table of size (n+1) x (W+1), and each entry is computed in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Space Complexity:\n",
    "# The space complexity is O(n * W) as well, since we use a 2D table to store the solutions to subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of 0/1 Knapsack:\n",
    "# 1. Resource Allocation: In scenarios where limited resources (e.g., money, time, or materials) need to be allocated optimally to maximize a certain benefit (e.g., profits or returns), \n",
    "#    such as in investment planning or project selection.\n",
    "# 2. Cargo Loading: In logistics, where the goal is to maximize the value of items loaded into a vehicle or container without exceeding its weight capacity.\n",
    "# 3. Budgeting: In business, to determine how to allocate a limited budget to various projects or departments to maximize returns.\n",
    "# 4. Cryptography: In the development of algorithms for encryption or digital signature schemes, where certain combinations of items (like keys or tokens) need to be selected for optimal security.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample Exam Questions & Answers:\n",
    "# Q1: What is the time complexity of the 0/1 Knapsack dynamic programming approach?\n",
    "# A1: The time complexity is O(n * W), where n is the number of items and W is the capacity of the knapsack.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: What is the purpose of the 2D array K in the knapSack function?\n",
    "# A2: The 2D array K is used to store the maximum value achievable for each combination of items and knapsack capacities. K[i][w] represents the maximum value achievable with the first i items and a knapsack of capacity w.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3: Explain the recurrence relation used in the DP solution for the 0/1 Knapsack problem.\n",
    "# A3: The recurrence relation is:\n",
    "#    K[i][w] = max(val[i-1] + K[i-1][w-wt[i-1]], K[i-1][w])\n",
    "#    If the current item can fit in the knapsack (wt[i-1] <= w), we have two choices: include the item (adding its value) or exclude it (keeping the value from the previous row). \n",
    "#    If the current item cannot fit, we exclude it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: What happens if the weight of an item is greater than the remaining capacity of the knapsack?\n",
    "# A4: If the weight of an item is greater than the remaining capacity, the item is excluded from the knapsack, and the value remains the same as the value for the previous item with the same remaining capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5: How can dynamic programming help solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem efficiently?\n",
    "# A5: Dynamic programming solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem efficiently by breaking it into overlapping subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations, \n",
    "# thus reducing the time complexity from exponential (brute-force) to polynomial.\n"
