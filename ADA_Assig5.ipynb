    "# Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "# The provided code solves a Club Assignment Problem using the Branch and Bound strategy \n",
    "# to assign students to clubs with minimal cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step-by-Step Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Class Definitions:\n",
    "# 1. Node: Represents a state in the search tree. Attributes include:\n",
    "#    - stud: Student ID being processed.\n",
    "#    - club: Club ID assigned to the student.\n",
    "#    - assigned: Boolean list indicating if a club is already assigned.\n",
    "#    - parent: Parent node in the search tree.\n",
    "#    - pathCost: Cost of the path to this node.\n",
    "#    - cost: Sum of pathCost and an estimated future cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. CustomHeap: Min-heap implemented using Python's heapq for managing nodes efficiently by their cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Helper Functions:\n",
    "# 1. new_node(): Creates a new Node instance.\n",
    "# 2. calc_cost(): Estimates the minimum cost of assigning remaining students to unassigned clubs. \n",
    "#    - This is achieved by finding the minimum possible cost for each unassigned student to an unassigned club, \n",
    "#      ensuring the solution remains admissible and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recursive Backtracking:\n",
    "# 1. print_assignmts(): Prints the path of assignments from the root to the current node in the solution tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Branch and Bound Implementation:\n",
    "# 1. find_min_cost():\n",
    "#    - A root node with no assignments is created and added to the priority queue.\n",
    "#    - Iteratively, nodes are expanded by assigning each unassigned club to the next student.\n",
    "#    - For each node, the pathCost (current cost) and the cost (including future estimate) are computed.\n",
    "#    - The node with the lowest cost is expanded next (priority queue ensures this).\n",
    "#    - When a leaf node (all students assigned) is reached, the solution with minimal cost is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main Function:\n",
    "# 1. Reads input for the number of students/clubs and their assignment costs.\n",
    "# 2. Calls find_min_cost() to determine the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Branch and Bound Strategy:\n",
    "# Theory: Branch and Bound (B&B) is a systematic way of solving optimization problems \n",
    "# by dividing them into smaller subproblems (branching) and eliminating those subproblems \n",
    "# that cannot produce better results than the current solution (bounding).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Features:\n",
    "# 1. State-Space Tree:\n",
    "#    - Each node represents a partial solution (assignment of some students to clubs).\n",
    "#    - The root node represents no assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Bounding Function:\n",
    "#    - Uses the calc_cost() function to estimate the lower bound of the solution at each node:\n",
    "#        cost(node) = pathCost(node) + estimate(node)\n",
    "#      Where:\n",
    "#        pathCost(node) = Σ(cost(i, club(i))) for all i ∈ assigned\n",
    "#        estimate(node): Calculated greedily for unassigned students.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Pruning:\n",
    "#    - Subtrees with costs greater than the best found so far are not explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "# 1. Time Complexity:\n",
    "#    - Worst-case: O(N!), where N is the number of students (or clubs), \n",
    "#      as all permutations of assignments may be considered.\n",
    "#    - Heuristic bounding reduces the effective number of nodes, making it faster than brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Space Complexity:\n",
    "#    - Priority queue stores O(N!) nodes in the worst case.\n",
    "#    - Each node requires O(N) space for the assigned array and parent pointers.\n",
    "#    - Overall: O(N ⋅ N!).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications:\n",
    "# 1. Task Scheduling: Assigning tasks to workers with minimal total cost.\n",
    "# 2. Resource Allocation: Allocating resources to processes in distributed systems.\n",
    "# 3. Transportation Problems: Assigning shipments to routes minimizing transportation costs.\n",
    "# 4. Event Planning: Assigning attendees to events with specific preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exam Invigilation Questions:\n",
    "# 1. What is the role of the calc_cost() function in the algorithm?\n",
    "#    - Answer: It calculates the lower bound (estimated future cost) for a partial solution \n",
    "#      by assigning unassigned students to clubs with the minimum cost available.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Why do we use a priority queue in this implementation?\n",
    "#    - Answer: To always expand the node with the lowest estimated total cost, ensuring optimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What is the difference between pathCost and cost in the Node class?\n",
    "#    - Answer: pathCost is the actual cost of assignments up to the current node. \n",
    "#      cost includes pathCost and the estimated cost of future assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. How does the algorithm ensure that it finds the optimal solution?\n",
    "#    - Answer: By expanding nodes in increasing order of their cost and pruning subtrees \n",
    "#      with costs higher than the current best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. What is the significance of the assigned array?\n",
    "#    - Answer: It tracks which clubs are already assigned, ensuring no club is assigned to more than one student.\n"
